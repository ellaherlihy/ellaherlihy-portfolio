    description: `This page was a simple static page built in a few hours as part of a tech challenge. The challenge was to take an existing page which was quite badly designed, design it first in Figma and then build in CSS and semantic HTML.
    I really enjoyed this challenge, and stripping back to HTML and CSS basics to just focus on making a site look good and be responsive. It was also a great opprotunity to practice designing a site in Figma before starting to code it - which in the
    long run always saves so much time!`,
